The ``tests`` module
====================

Using the ``matrix_divided`` function
-------------------------------------

This is a test file for the test driven development module. First thing is to import the module

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
	>>> print(matrix)
	[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, "j", 6]]
	>>> try:
	...	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
	>>> try:
	...	matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 9]]
	...	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	Each row of the matrix must have the same size
	>>> try:
	...	matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	...	print(matrix_divided(matrix, "p"))
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	div must be a number
	>>> try:
	...	matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	...	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	division by zero
	>>> try:
	...	print(matrix_divided(None, 6))
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	[[]]
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3]]
        >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0]]
	>>> matrix = [[]]
        >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[]]
