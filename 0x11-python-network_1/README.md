| 0. What's my status? #0 | Write a Python script that fetches https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status | [0-hbtn_status.py](0-hbtn_status.py) |
| 1. Response header value #0 | Write a Python script that takes in a URL and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable found in the header of the response | [1-hbtn_header.py](1-hbtn_header.py) |
| 2. POST an email #0 | Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and displays the body of the response (decoded in utf-8) | [2-post_email.py](2-post_email.py) |

| 4. What's my status? #1 | Write a Python script that fetches https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status using the requests library | [4-hbtn_status.py](4-hbtn_status.py) |
| 5. Response header value #1 | Write a Python script that takes in a URL and displays the value of the variable X-Request-Id in the response header using the requests library | [5-hbtn_header.py](5-hbtn_header.py) |
| 6. POST an email #1 | Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response using the requests library | [6-post_email.py](6-post_email.py) |
| 7. Error code #1 | Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response. If the HTTP status code is greater than or equal to 400, print: Error code: followed by the value of the HTTP status code | [7-error_code.py](7-error_code.py) |
| 8. Search API | Write a Python script that takes in a letter and sends a POST request to http://0.0.0.0:5000/search_user with the letter as a parameter. Display user information if available, otherwise display appropriate messages | [8-json_api.py](8-json_api.py) |
| 9. My GitHub! | Write a Python script that takes your GitHub credentials (username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your id | [10-my_github.py](10-my_github.py) |
